# Hourly

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.1.

This aims to find the salary monthly, weekly, daily, hourly and annually with any of the given value.

Just input any one of it and get the results for the other.

Also, default work week is set to be 40 and that can also be changed which will give the estimated value for hourly rate.

All these are just approximations and estimations, and can't be used as a proof or reference.
